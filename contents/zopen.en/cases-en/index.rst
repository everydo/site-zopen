Successful cases
=====================

The Culture Ministry of P.R.C.
==================================

Site: http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/

This is a large portal site. It collects all Chinese culture infomation. There are more than 300,000 contents and more than 100 types of contents in the portal. 

Here some some statistic data from the AWStats (During March 1 - March 22, 2005)

- 346371 persons visits the site 520178 times
- 2904077 pages are visited, 
- 10147972 files are downloaded, totoally 85.90 GB files

The portal is a big success to the previous private solution.

Shanghai Airlines
==========================
This is a knowledge portal for the IT department. All department related knowlege are stored in the portal. Other departments, such as business department, are now coming to use the system too.

One other important feature in the portal is project management. All projects documents are stored in the project area in the portal. Each project has a independent sub-portal. Other features like bug-tracking and calendaring exist too.

Also, we devolopped a task management system for them.

Shanghai Telecom
==========================
This is a project document management system.  

It has simliar feature like what we does in the shanghai air-line project.

One thing special is, we integrate the site with IBM's LDAP server - Tivoli Directory Server.
